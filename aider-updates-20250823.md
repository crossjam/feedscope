# Feedscope Authentication Improvements

**Date:** August 23, 2025  
**Session Duration:** ~30 minutes  
**Git Commits:** f22ed30, 7531cdd

## Overview

Enhanced the feedscope CLI tool's authentication system by restructuring credential storage and adding credential management subcommands.

## Changes Made

### 1. TOML Config Structure Reorganization (f22ed30)

**Problem:** Credentials were stored at the root level of the TOML config file, making the structure flat and less organized.

**Solution:** 
- Modified `FeedscopeConfig` to use `toml_table_header=("auth",)` in pydantic settings
- Updated the `save()` method to create and store credentials in an `[auth]` section
- Config file now has clean structure with credentials properly sectioned

**Before:**
```toml
email = "user@example.com"
password = "password123"
```

**After:**
```toml
[auth]
email = "user@example.com"
password = "password123"
```

### 2. Auth Command Restructure with Remove Functionality (7531cdd)

**Problem:** Single `auth` command limited extensibility for additional authentication operations.

**Solution:**
- Created `auth_app` typer group for authentication commands
- Converted single `auth` command into a command group with subcommands
- Renamed original command to `auth login`
- Added `auth remove` subcommand to delete stored credentials

**New CLI Structure:**
- `feedscope auth login <email>` - authenticate and save credentials
- `feedscope auth remove` - remove stored authentication credentials
- `feedscope auth --help` - show available auth commands

## Technical Implementation Details

- **TOML Manipulation:** Uses tomlkit library to preserve file formatting when editing config
- **Error Handling:** Proper validation for missing config files and auth sections
- **User Experience:** Rich console output with colored success/error messages
- **Code Organization:** Clean separation of authentication concerns into dedicated command group

## Files Modified

- `src/feedscope/__init__.py` - Main CLI module with config management and auth commands

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test credential storage and retrieval with new TOML structure
2. Verify `auth login` command saves credentials correctly
3. Confirm `auth remove` command properly deletes auth section
4. Test error handling for missing config files
5. Validate backward compatibility with existing config files

## Future Enhancements

- Add `auth status` command to check current authentication state
- Implement credential validation without API calls
- Add support for multiple authentication profiles
- Consider encrypted credential storage options
